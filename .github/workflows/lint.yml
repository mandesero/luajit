  # An update of a developer branch cancels the previously

  # etc.) workflow runs are never canceled.
  #
  # We use a trick here: define the concurrency group as 'workflow
  # run ID' + # 'workflow run attempt' because it is a unique
  # combination for any run. So it effectively discards grouping.
  #
  # XXX: we cannot use `github.sha` as a unique identifier because
  # pushing a tag may cancel a run that works on a branch push
  # event.
