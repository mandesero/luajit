-- This test file demonstrates the following problem:
-- The assembly of an IR instruction allocates a constant into a
-- free register. Then it spills another register (due to high
-- register pressure), which is rematerialized using the same
-- constant (which it assumes is now in the allocated register).
-- In case when the first register also happens to be the
-- destination register, the constant value is modified before the
-- rematerialization.
--
-- For the code below we get the following register allocation
-- order (read from top to bottom (DBG RA reversed)):
-- | current IR | operation | IR ref | register
-- |  0048         alloc       0038     x0
-- |  0048         remat       K038     x0
-- |  0048         alloc       K023     x4
--
-- Which leads to the following assembly:
-- | ...
-- | add   x4, x4, x0    # x4 modified before x0 rematerialization
-- | ldrb  w4, [x4, #24]
-- | add   x0, x4, #24   # constant x0 rematerialization
-- | ...
-- As a result, the value register x0 holding is incorrect.
